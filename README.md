# Math Explainer GPT

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue?logo=python)

My personal project exploring how **LLMs (Large Language Models)** can be applied to **maths education**.  
The goal is to generate **step-by-step explanations** for maths problems and eventually build a full app around it.

---

## Project Goals
- Use GPT-based models to provide structured, clear solutions for maths problems  
- Explore **prompt engineering** techniques for better step-by-step reasoning  
- Experiment with **API integration** (OpenAI API and FastAPI)  
- Develop a simple **web app interface** (Flask/FastAPI backend, possible frontend later)  

---

## Current Status
- Researching prompt engineering for maths reasoning  
- Testing Python scripts to call GPT via API  
- Designing structure for a future app  

---

##  Planned Features
- Input maths problem (text/LaTeX)  
- Generate step-by-step explanations  
- Adjustable explanation depth (basic vs advanced)  
- Export/share solutions  
- Web UI for user interaction  

---

##  Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Experiment with GPT prompts in Python (WIP)  
- **Phase 2**: Build API wrapper for maths problem solving  
- **Phase 3**: Develop simple web app frontend  
- **Phase 4**: Refine, test, and release
